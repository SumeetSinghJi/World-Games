                                                WELCOME


"As the author, I always wanted to learn programming. Growing up in the 90s shareware gaming era, the internet 
wasn't as widespread, fast, affordable, or accessible during that time period. The lack of the Internet left 
very few ways to enjoy video games. Electronic games were mainly accessed through the arcade, which was an 
expensive hobby, handheld and home game consoles, which had little public documentation, leaving the only way 
to judge a game's fun to viewing the boxed art, leaving little room for errors in judgment and another 
expensive endeavor.

Thankfully, operating systems at the time had free inbuilt games that became the subject of speculation and 
fascination. However, the only way to enjoy the games at that age or time was limited to access on school 
computers with limited libraries of installed games, and with supervision, leaving approval of games played up 
to the ever-dominant and watchful eyes of the teachers' moral approval.

This left the only way to enjoy games repeatedly without any costly endeavors were the utopian abundance of 
demonstration games known as demos, which were free and often limited in gameplay samples of computer games. The 
easiest method of obtaining them was free diskettes known as floppy disks or floppies and CD-ROMs shortened to 
CDs found in technology and gaming-focused magazines that were often purchased from local news agencies.

The low cost of the barrier, ease, often non-existent standards to program and develop computer games meant that 
many game developers published their works often through the aforementioned media, and the time period was 
colloquially and fondly referred to as the Shareware era. Shareware games could be copied for free on other media 
and spread to families and friends, bringing the cost barrier to electronic gaming down to accessible levels.

Floppies and CDs would be inserted and the drive accessed on the computer, where you could browse the game's 
contents known as folders in Windows. Games folders would contain many files such as images, videos, music known 
as assets used by the game, as well as the executables, the software to run and play the game. The lack of 
knowledge on video games and digital media at the time meant that browsing a game's content on the computer could 
lead to finding cheats about a game, viewing fascinating artwork, stories in game manuals, that could be copied 
to the local computer and accessed anytime, leading to a revolution in video game ownership contrasted to 
expensive arcade visits with coin slot machines and foreign expensive priced game consoles and cartridge games.

The process of acquiring a new game-filled floppy or CD with new mysterious experiences and browsing the contents 
on a computer and adding them to my growing collection created lifelong positive memories. The acquisition of 
new games and thus technology became my passion.

In memory of the Shareware developers that created media that brought joy to my life, I wanted to replicate the 
process. Learning video game development was a step in the right direction. C++ was a programming language at the 
time I remember in my deepest memories; I could recall many advising it as the next best technology. Although C++
has been overtaken by newer programming languages, I wanted to replicate the old mysterious process of my 
shareware heroes and create a simple 90s-style shareware era game and related contents such as this manual.

Recreating historical board games as a computer game was a simple, interesting, and replayable project I could 
attempt, and thus I set out on a year and a bit more journey to fulfill. Programming this video game was one of 
the most enjoyable experiences in my life and brought closure to an innermost fascination I held being on a 
journey emulating my shareware era developer heroes I admired when younger.

Thus, I hope this story and game evoke similar enjoyable moments for you. I encourage you, at least once in your 
life, to pursue a nostalgic lifelong fascination you have, as it may bring closure to subconscious desires."

GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE & GAME NAVIGATION

Game menu and navigation is based on SDL Game design best practice "scenes".
There are scenes for all different menu options e.g. Settings, or Credits, and a
central hub "scene 6" for in game world map which interconnects with other in game
scenes e.g. "scene 30 = Beijing" where different maps/levels/scenes can be accessed
which all have slight variations of the named function start_spr_game() function depending 
on regional variations.

headers SDL_renders and SDL_texts will load the HUD depending on regional variation of game.
Navigating through scene is dependent on handle_events() button clicks in GAME LOGIC

Graphical navigation is dictated by button object created from the Custom_SDL_button class
within custom_SDL_button.hpp that are clickable as defined in sdl_mouse_handles.hpp

Uses headers;

#include "headers/sdl_loads.hpp"            // SDL Textures, Sounds, Animations to load
#include "headers/sdl_renders.hpp"          // SDL Rect/Buttons to render to screen/scene/GUI
#include "headers/sdl_texts.hpp"            // SDL Text to Render to screen/scene/GUI
#include "headers/sdl_mouse_handles.hpp"    // SDL Mouse and Touch keypresses
#include "headers/sdl_keyboard_handles.hpp" // SDL Keyboard keypresses
#include "headers/sdl_gamepad_handles.hpp"  // SDL Gamepad controller keypresses
#include "headers/custom_SDL_button.hpp"    // Custom SDL Button class for creating buttons for handles


GAMEPLAY

Each individual board or hand video game is encapsulated within it's own header file which uses shared
SDL logic with the main and related headers.

Uses headers;
#include "headers/tic_tac_toe.hpp"          // Scene 32 - Rome - Tic Tac Toe



SAVING AND RESTORING GAME

A save game text file world-games_save.txt is created on SDL Quit and on main menu Continue button loaded.

Uses headers;
#include "headers/save_game.hpp"             // For save/continue functions



UPDATING GAME

There is an in game option to update game. It will contact a repository hosting game depending on which platform
game was downloaded and installed from, which will check the latest version string then download and replace the
existing game directory while retaining save game files.

Uses headers;
#include "headers/download_game.hpp"        // For downloading latest game update
#include "headers/install_game.hpp"        // For Installing latest game update



MULTIPLAYER

Multiplayer use requires creating an account which consists of a username, email and password. During
new game or when Multiplayer scene is selected an option will appear to sign up and register for online
services. Once Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions are accepted, a CURL function will push user account 
details to the developers website/webserver i.e, agnisamooh.com A verification email will be sent out to users
to verify their account. Once verified users will be able to login and view, host and join server or user
created games for online play. Users can find, add and communicate with friends in game and play along with 
them. Leaderboard information will be available in game and publically as per privacy policy notice if 
enforced.

Beijing (China) - Rock paper scissors (Chinese; romanized: Shoushiling, traditional: 手勢令. simplified: 手势令)

A seemingly simple game of chance, has woven its way into cultures worldwide, transcending generations and 
borders. Despite its apparent simplicity, its origins are steeped in history, folklore, and strategic 
subtleties. This humble game finds its roots in ancient civilizations and evolves continuously, embracing
new forms and variations.

Origins and Folklore:
The exact origins of rock-paper-scissors are shrouded in mystery, with multiple theories tracing its roots
across different cultures. One of the earliest known versions dates back to China during the 
Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). This version, known as "shoushiling," featured hand gestures representing
a rock, a piece of cloth, and scissors. Legend has it that this game was used to resolve disputes and make 
decisions, much like its contemporary usage.

Another theory traces its origins to Japan, where the game was called "jan-ken." It was believed to have
been introduced in the 17th century, gaining popularity among children and adults alike. In Japanese 
folklore, it's said that the game was used by samurai to settle conflicts and make decisions in a manner
that was akin to divination.

Rules and Gameplay:
The game revolves around three elements: rock, paper, and scissors. Each element defeats one and is defeated
by another, creating a cyclic relationship:

Rock crushes scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
Players face off by simultaneously forming one of the three shapes with their hands. After a count or a 
chant, both reveal their chosen gesture, and the winner is determined based on the hierarchy of interactions. 
The game often follows a best-of-three or best-of-five format, adding suspense and strategy.

Cultural Significance and Variations:
Rock-paper-scissors is not merely a game but a cultural phenomenon. It has made its way into various aspects 
of society, from resolving disputes to being used in decision-making processes. Its simplicity and universality 
have led to its integration into pop culture, sports, and even academic research.

Interestingly, different cultures have their variations of the game. For instance, the Korean version, 
"kai-bai-bo," features similar hand gestures but with different names and meanings. In some versions, 
there are additional elements like a well, a lion, or a spock, introducing further complexities and strategies.

Unique Trivia:
Competitive Tournaments: Believe it or not, there are competitive rock-paper-scissors tournaments held 
worldwide. Participants strategize and compete for prizes, showcasing their skill in a seemingly luck-based 
game.

AI and Strategy: Researchers have developed AI programs specifically designed to excel at rock-paper-scissors. 
These programs analyze patterns in human behavior and adapt strategies, demonstrating the complexities within 
what seems like a simple game.

Decision-Making Tool: Beyond its entertainment value, rock-paper-scissors has found applications in 
decision-making processes. Its randomness and unbiased nature make it an interesting tool in scenarios 
where impartial choices are needed.

In summary, rock-paper-scissors transcends its simplistic appearance, embodying centuries of cultural 
heritage and human interaction. Its adaptability and universality continue to fascinate and entertain people 
across the globe, proving that even the simplest of games can carry profound significance in society.
