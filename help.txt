                                    GAME PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT & LOGIC

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


ENVIRONMENT

C++ game was built on a Windows 11 Operating System desktop environment using Visual Studio code as the IDE.
Game is written in c++ however uses a C programming language library framework 
called SDL2, along with 3 associated SDL2 libraries to create a interactive GUI Window

all 3 Frameworks are downloaded from GitHub
SDL2 (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL)- Used for creating a Window and rendering buttons and key inputs

SDL2_Mixer (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) - Library for adding sound/music to a SDL2 application
SDL2_TTF (https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf) - Library for rendering text/font to SDL2 Window

uses headers below
#include <SDL.h>                          // SDL Requirement
#include <SDL_image.h>                    // SDL Requirement
#include <SDL_ttf.h>                      // SDL Requirement

GAME NAVIGATION

Game menu and navigation is based on SDL Game design best practice "scenes".
There are scenes for all different menu options e.g. Settings, or Credits, and a
central hub "scene 6" for in game world map which interconnects with other in game
scenes e.g. "scene 30 = Beijing" where different maps/levels/scenes can be accessed
which all have slight variations of the named function start_spr_game() function depending on regional variations.

headers SDL_renders and SDL_texts will load the HUD depending on regional variation of game.
Navigating through scene is dependent on handle_events() button clicks in GAME LOGIC



SAVING AND LOADING/CONTINUE

A save game text file world-games_save.txt is created on SDL Quit and on main menu Continue button loaded.
uses header below
#include "headers/savegame.h"             // For save/continue functions



UPDATING GAME

There is an in game option to update game. It will contact a repository hosting game depending on which platform
game was downloaded and installed from, which will check the latest version string then download and replace the
existing game directory while retaining save game files.

Uses both headers below
#include "headers/game_update_1.h"        // For downloading latest game update
#include "headers/game_update_2.h"        // For downloading latest game update



MULTIPLAYER

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT - There is future scope to add an multiplayer mode however the time taken for author
to learn C++ web development will take precious time spent elsewhere. Regardless the files and scenes
are in game but not useable.
Uses header below
#include "headers/multiplayer.h"          // FUTURE DEVELOPMENT - For Multiplayer

Beijing (China) - Rock paper scissors (Chinese; romanised: Shoushiling, traditional: 手勢令. simplified: 手势令)

A seemingly simple game of chance, has woven its way into cultures worldwide, transcending generations and 
borders. Despite its apparent simplicity, its origins are steeped in history, folklore, and strategic 
subtleties. This humble game finds its roots in ancient civilizations and evolves continuously, embracing
new forms and variations.

Origins and Folklore:
The exact origins of rock-paper-scissors are shrouded in mystery, with multiple theories tracing its roots
across different cultures. One of the earliest known versions dates back to China during the 
Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). This version, known as "shoushiling," featured hand gestures representing
a rock, a piece of cloth, and scissors. Legend has it that this game was used to resolve disputes and make 
decisions, much like its contemporary usage.

Another theory traces its origins to Japan, where the game was called "jan-ken." It was believed to have
been introduced in the 17th century, gaining popularity among children and adults alike. In Japanese 
folklore, it's said that the game was used by samurai to settle conflicts and make decisions in a manner
that was akin to divination.

Rules and Gameplay:
The game revolves around three elements: rock, paper, and scissors. Each element defeats one and is defeated
by another, creating a cyclic relationship:

Rock crushes scissors.
Scissors cut paper.
Paper covers rock.
Players face off by simultaneously forming one of the three shapes with their hands. After a count or a 
chant, both reveal their chosen gesture, and the winner is determined based on the hierarchy of interactions. 
The game often follows a best-of-three or best-of-five format, adding suspense and strategy.

Cultural Significance and Variations:
Rock-paper-scissors is not merely a game but a cultural phenomenon. It has made its way into various aspects 
of society, from resolving disputes to being used in decision-making processes. Its simplicity and universality 
have led to its integration into pop culture, sports, and even academic research.

Interestingly, different cultures have their variations of the game. For instance, the Korean version, 
"kai-bai-bo," features similar hand gestures but with different names and meanings. In some versions, 
there are additional elements like a well, a lion, or a spock, introducing further complexities and strategies.

Unique Trivia:
Competitive Tournaments: Believe it or not, there are competitive rock-paper-scissors tournaments held 
worldwide. Participants strategize and compete for prizes, showcasing their skill in a seemingly luck-based 
game.

AI and Strategy: Researchers have developed AI programs specifically designed to excel at rock-paper-scissors. 
These programs analyze patterns in human behavior and adapt strategies, demonstrating the complexities within 
what seems like a simple game.

Decision-Making Tool: Beyond its entertainment value, rock-paper-scissors has found applications in 
decision-making processes. Its randomness and unbiased nature make it an interesting tool in scenarios 
where impartial choices are needed.

In summary, rock-paper-scissors transcends its simplistic appearance, embodying centuries of cultural 
heritage and human interaction. Its adaptability and universality continue to fascinate and entertain people 
across the globe, proving that even the simplest of games can carry profound significance in society.
